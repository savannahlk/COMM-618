# Jan. 21 Assignment 2

Dear editor,

A story I'm proposing seeks to answer the question: **Is COVID having a lasting effect on the U.S. movie industry now past the height of the pandemic?**

To answer this, I plan to use a couple of data sets. Starting with [one from Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/file/poll/388571/220107Movies.pdf), Americans are self-reporting seeing fewer movies than in years before the pandemic. As a trusted polling source, Gallup’s data is reliable and could be attributed to without issue. These particular numbers show a clear drop in movies watched in the theater in 2021 compared to over a decade ago. 

In addition, I also plan to reference [data from The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/market/), a data site specifically for the film industry. I have looked into The Numbers on their own website, which describes thorough methods of obtaining data, and I believe it is a reliable source. They have data on ticket sales and revenue for movie theaters nationally going back to the 1990’s. Focusing just on the last five years, there is a sharp decline in 2020, which is to be expected as theaters were shut down and people isolated at home. While there has been some growth since, sales and revenue have yet to rebound to pre-pandemic numbers.

These are the main data sets I plan to look at in attempting to address the question of interest. However, I think the answer might be further supported by trying to correlate this data on movie theaters with data on streaming service subscriptions. To do this, I’ll chart The Numbers and Gallup data side-by-side with the number of Netflix, Hulu and Disney+ subscriptions over the years to see if there is any correlation.

Best,

Savannah
