Dear Editor,

**Question of interest**: Does Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre cite the Hatch Act more often than her predecessors (including in the Trump administration)?

Some members of the White House Press Corps have complained that the Hatch Act — a law prohibiting employees in the executive branch from engaging in political activities — has [become a "verbal crutch"](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2022/12/15/the-hatch-act-prevents-you-from-reading-this-email-00074209) for Jean-Pierre to use to avoid answering questions during press briefings. Reporters have alleged that she cites the law more often than past press secretaries in response to their questions. 

If true, a factor influencing this tendency could include the fact that Jean-Pierre's predecessor, Jen Psaki, was found in violation of the Hatch Act months before her departure. Plus, the Office of Special Counsel [found several violations by press secretaries](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/probe-finds-trump-officials-repeatedly-violated-hatch-act) in the Trump administration.

I could not find existing public data with the number of Hatch Act references made by each press secretary since 2016 during press briefings. However, this is information I would be able to compile, perhaps with the assistance of another reporter or newsroom intern (since there are hundreds of transcripts to go through, any help would reduce the amount of time it would take for data collection). I have easy access to the source of this data, as the White House press briefings for both administrations are available online:
* https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/
* https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/

I will go through every press briefing transcript (excluding transcripts from events like "Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials" or "A Farewell Message from First Lady Melania Trump") and search for "Hatch Act" to see how many times, if any, the phrase was used by that press secretary.

The specific data I am looking to collect is: the total number of times "Hatch Act" was said in every press briefing by each of the Trump administration's four press secretaries and both of the Biden administration's two press secretaries. The numbers alone will help answer the question of interest, by allowing me to directly compare Jean-Pierre's usage to other press secretaries and see if there is any truth to reporters' complaints. For a more accurate comparison, though, I will note how many days each press secretary actually served, along with counting the number of press briefings they held, and find the average amount of "Hatch Act" references they each made. 

Data so far:

|Press Secretary|Press briefing date|No. of Hatch Act ref.|Min. of briefing|
---|---|---|---|
|Karine Jean-Pierre|1/27/2023|0|61|
|KJP|1/25/2023|0|64|
|KJP|1/24/2023|0|56|
|KJP|1/20/2023|0|55|
|KJP|1/18/2023|0|53|
|KJP|1/17/2023|0|48|
|KJP|1/13/2023|0|55|
|KJP|1/12/2023|0|63|
|KJP|1/11/2023|0|58|
|KJP|1/6/2023|0|58|
|KJP|1/3/2023|0|60|
|KJP|12/19/2022|1|44|
|KJP|12/15/2022|0|48|
|KJP|12/13/2022|3|29|

Second table, will need to find totals to fill it out:

|Press Secretary|Total # of Hatch references|Days in role|No. of briefings|
---|---|---|---|
Karine Jean-Pierre|?|260 (ongoing)|?|
Jen Psaki|?|478|?|
Kayleigh McEnany|?|288|?|
Stephanie Grisham|?|281|?|
Sarah Huckabee Sanders|?|710|?|
Sean Spicer|?|182|?|
