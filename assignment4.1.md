To whom it may concern:

I am writing to request access to copies of public records that contain information on attendance and graduation in all Brazoria County schools over the last twenty years. This request is pursuant to the state public information act Tex. Gov’t Code §552.001 et seq.

I agree to pay any reasonable fees for searching or copying these records up to $50. Please inform me if the cost will exceed this amount.

Please provide the records in electronic format. If it isn't possible to email them, please let me know so we can arrange another method of transfer.

I look forward to your response within ten (10) business days.

If you deny this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.

Thank you for considering my request,

Savannah Kuchar
