# DCPS salaries struggle against pandemic burdens
## Teachers in D.C. earn some of the highest salaries of any major city, yet COVID-19 and district conditions still weigh on retention rates.

Last May, D.C. Public Schools [rolled out a series of new advertisements](https://dcps.dc.gov/release/dc-public-schools-launches-advertisement-campaign-expand-teacher-workforce) recruiting potential educators to what one banner calls “one of the highest paying teacher workforces in the nation!” 

The ads, which can be spotted [on buses and trains around the District](https://dcpsstrong.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DCPS-Teacher-Recruitment-Advertisements.pdf), emphasize the higher pay and possible $2,500 signing bonuses. 

According to reported salaries from D.C. Human Resources and salary schedules from other major cities, Washington, D.C. does in fact have competitive pay for its teachers. Throughout the course of their careers, teachers here will on average make more than their counterparts with Bachelor’s degrees in the major metropolitans of Houston and Chicago, along with those in Memphis, a city of comparable population to D.C.

In their first five years, a D.C. teacher will make about $20,000 more than a Houston teacher’s and almost $28,000 higher than that of a Memphis teacher. By the time that D.C. educator has spent a little more than a decade in the position, they could see their salary hit six figures, while those in Houston and Memphis who spend over thirty years teaching would still be earning around $78,000 and $71,000, respectively.

Financial incentives in the form of higher salaries and bonuses for certain positions is a recruiting strategy for DCPS. And [numbers from the Office of the State Superintendent of Education in D.C.](https://osse.dc.gov/page/district-columbia-educator-retention) show teacher retention rates improving in recent years. Between the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years, 12% of teachers left the district, down from the 16% that left right before the 2019-20 year and pandemic.

This most recent retention number puts D.C. on track with [the latest national statistic](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/slc), which showed that about a decade ago between 2011 and 2013, around 11% of teachers left for another school district or the profession entirely, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 

Since the pandemic, which added a slew of financial and emotional burdens to the job, teacher turnover has likely increased, said Robert Shand, assistant professor in the School of Education at American University. The number of teachers who have left or changed districts nationwide since COVID-19 began, though, has yet to be reliably quantified, he said. 

“We have a crisis of teacher recruitment and retention, between teachers leaving due to COVID and being upset with the response to COVID, and teachers being more stressed out than ever before, and the economy being really strong and so people have a lot of outside options,” Shand said.

A [2021 report by the RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1108-1.html), a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization, found that nearly one in four teachers surveyed across the country said they would likely leave the job at the end of the school year. The report attributed this increased desire to leave to greater stress, burnout and mental health struggles.

“I’m simultaneously teaching full-time while monitoring my elementary school age daughter’s learning and being her primary caregiver [at] all hours of the day with no support,” one teacher was quoted saying in the RAND report.

COVID-19-related challenges continue for teachers, despite the pandemic drawing to a close and schools reopening, said Jennifer Steele, associate professor at American’s School of Education and expert in education policy and economics.

“When kids come back to school after the pandemic, they're stressed, they're still having trauma from the pandemic and from school closures. And so teachers are dealing with that as well, while teachers are also dealing with the health stressors from their own families. So teachers have been under a lot of pressure since the pandemic,” Steele said.

In her job teaching master’s degree students, many of whom are DCPS teachers, Steele said she hears firsthand some of their disappointment with the profession.

“They love the students. But there's a frustration with policies that make it hard to serve students, especially when the infrastructure is not there, the technological infrastructure, the support from administrators for maintaining a safe and supportive schooling environment for the students,” Steele said.

Teachers face other challenging work conditions that are specific to D.C. public schools, Shand said, for which better pay is not always enough to compensate. 

“In D.C., teachers are required to work relatively long hours and longer school years and have a lot more of their time managed than in a lot of other districts. And so that high pay also comes at a cost to the teachers,” Shand said.

In past negotiations with DCPS, Shand said the Washington Teachers Union, representing public school teachers across the District, prioritized better salaries and conceded to conditions including more staff development days.

“They did want to achieve at least pay parity with suburbs. They didn't want teachers leaving D.C. to go to the suburbs. They wanted to make it a sustainable career for teachers that could support a family and live in the D.C. area, and so they prioritized compensation. And DCPS in essence asked in exchange for more time from teachers and more control over teachers' time,” Shand said.

In Boston, where teacher salaries are on average slightly above those in D.C., retention of public school teachers in 2022 was 83%, according to [the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education](https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/profiles/teacher.aspx?orgcode=00350000&orgtypecode=5&leftNavId=15619&). 

A [2022 survey of educators by the Chicago chapter of Educators for Excellence](https://e4e.org/sites/default/files/voices_from_the_classroom_-_chicago_2022_final.pdf) reported that 56% of those asked said they would “very likely” spend their entire career as a Chicago teacher and 30% said this was “somewhat likely” for them.

While higher pay is desirable and could help attract or keep some teachers, the experts say it is more often a secondary concern.

“Teachers will change their location [and] they will change what kind of school they teach in for financial incentives, but they won't change it dramatically,” Steele said. “Fifteen to 25% will change their behavior for substantial incentives, but there's so much more. There's just the experience of feeling like your job is doable, and that you're supported in doing your job.”
