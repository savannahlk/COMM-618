## ARTICLE:

While Donald Trump’s own reelection committee received thousands in distributions for his 2020 campaign, his commercial businesses were profiting from the election season then and in 2018. 

Other candidates' political action committees, such as Kevin McCarthy for Congress for the House Speaker, or Republican committees including the Bold Conservatives PAC spent a collective hundreds of thousands on Trump businesses in the general and primary elections both years.

The former president’s benefitting properties include his Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., which received a combined over $100,000 in 2018 and 2020 payments for lodging, catering and other travel purposes. While businesses in D.C. and New York had the highest profit, others — like the Trump National Golf Course in California which earned almost $8,000 in 2018 contributions for reasons like campaign events or venue rental — also saw an election season revenue bump.

*[Quote from an expert or reference to additional data about how this compares to non-election years, as well as other election years before Trump was President and was just a celebrity businessman — did the properties still attract Republican leaders and candidates even back then?]*

These properties had seen a healthy income of campaign disbursements since Trump entered the political arena back in 2016, during which his hotels, restaurants and even ice water company saw a cumulative nearly $25,000. This sum jumped to around $47,000 two years later and again nearly doubled in 2020, when Trump’s businesses took in around $80,000 in disbursements.

This politically-driven economic boost may be fading, though. Trump’s business properties received just one such payment during the 2022 election cycle. John Kennedy for US, the PAC for Louisiana’s junior senator reelected for his second term this year, spent $1,850 on lodging at Trump’s D.C. hotel for the 2022 primary. And the date of this disbursement was in August 2017, years before Kennedy appeared on the general November ballot.

*[Quote an expert addressing why his properties received less money and business from GOP politicians and the national Republican committees during this year’s midterm cycle — is this indicative of his waning popularity, including in his own party?]*

## NOTE:

I made multiple pivot tables to examine this data, one of which separated the recipients by state, so I could see both the number and sum of contributions made to each business in each state. In another I separated these recipients by year to see the trend in disbursments by election cycle. And the third table looked at the committees  themeselves and how many disbursements they made, along with the sum of these disbursements.

To see these tables and the rest of my data, [here is my spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T70wW6tsLRs_K8Jp1JWN-OWJZpciXy0KdyaWVWfah-M/edit?usp=sharing)
