## DONE

**TOPIC:** How does pay for D.C. teachers compare to those in other major U.S. cities, and is the salary incentivizing more teachers to stay in the job?

**DETAILS:** An advertisement on the metro train claims that D.C. has “one of the highest paying teacher workforces in the nation!” 
Does the data support this? Looking at the D.C. employee salary information, which is [publicly available](https://dchr.dc.gov/publicbodyinfo), I will compare the pay for teachers here to those in other major cities, whose salary data can also be found online. Specifically, I will compare D.C. to five of the country’s largest cities as well as five major cities smaller than the district. 

If the DCPS metro ad turns out to be correct, I'm curious whether D.C. teachers are being motivated to stay with better salaries. Nationwide, more and more teachers are leaving the profession for reasons including long hours, burnout and low pay. Is this happening in D.C. as well, or has monetary incentive helped reverse or at least curb the retention loss? To answer this, I will look at [data from the DC State Superintendent of Education](https://osse.dc.gov/page/faculty-and-staff-data-collection) and then talk with teachers and/or administrators to get their thoughts on whatever the data shows.
