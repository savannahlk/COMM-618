# COMM 618 Class survey data results show mostly consensus

Spreadsheets were the only tool with which every person in the class had at least some prior experience. Others, including Freedom of Information act requests and programming language, were less familiar to the group. Most students came to the class with zero experience using such tools.

Tools ranked by average class familiarity:
* Spreadsheets
* Freedom of Information Act requests
* Programming or scripting language 
* Version control system
* Structured Query Language (tied with above)

The cohort's journalistic interests were generally similar, with politics and investigations ranking as the top categories. In terms of mediums, written articles fared well with the group, selected by every person. After that, video and graphics were of top interest, each picked by almost half of the class. 

Beyond the class material, students in the class had a diverse selection of favorite movies. Romantic comedies were well represented, with half of the class naming movies in this genre. There was a near-even split when it came to choosing between one horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses to confront. Five students selected the latter option, making it the narrow winner over a horse-sized duck, which earned three votes.
